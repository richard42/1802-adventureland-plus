1802 Adventureland+ README
--------------------------

Are you ready to brave the dismal swamp, sleeping dragon, hungry bear, deadly
insects, and other threats that await the interpid player in Adventureland+?
If so, look no further for hours of puzzle solving fun as you attempt to
prevail over this early Scott Adams gem by collecting all 13 treasures without
losing everything in the process.

This text adventure game is a port written in 1802 assembly language, based on
the enhanced C version of Adventureland, called advland2019, as published in
March 2019 on the Interactive Fiction archive:

https://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/scott-adams/games/

The custom version of Adventureland+ also includes a decompressor and loader,
which allows it to fit in the unused 12 kilobytes of EPROM space available in
the 1802 Membership Card Serial Monitor Program Version 2.0, from Chuck Yakym.

1. Requirements and Pre-requisites
----------------------------------

The following software packages are required in order to build the 1802
Adventureland+ game:

  - C/C++ compiler: GCC, Clang, Visual Studio, etc.
  - Python 2.7 or 3.x
  - A18, the 1802 cross-assembler
    (available from: http://www.retrotechnology.com/memship/a18.html)

2. Building the Adventureland+ game
-----------------------------------------

1. Install the development tools (C compiler and Python)
2. Download the A18 cross-assembler from the link provided and use your
   compiler to build it. Place the "a18" executable in the "tools" folder.
3. Build the "ulz" compressor with the source code in the tools/ulz-encoder
   folder, and copy the "ulz" executable into the "tools" folder
4. To build the game in its uncompressed form, with the HEX output format,
   run the "build_ram.sh" script.  The output file will be named:
   "adventureland.hex" and the game can be started by jumping to address $0010
   after loading the HEX file via the MCSMP serial monitor.
5. To build a ROM image which contains the compressed game data and a special
   boot loader, run the "build_rom.py" script. The output file will be named
   "mcsmp20r_final.bin" and can be burned directly to a 32 kilobyte EPROM
   device such as a 27C256 and installed into a Membership Card computer. The
   monitor program included on this version of the ROM image contains an extra
   key command for launching the game, which is activated by pressing "P".

* Windows Build Instructions *

The build scripts included with this software are designed to run on Unix-based
computers running MacOS or Linux.  A few extra steps are needed to build this
game under Windows. The BASH shell scripts, "build_ram.sh" and "build_clean.sh"
can easily be converted to batch files by removing the first line, changing
"rm -f" to "del", and changing the path to the "a18" assembler program.

* Hardware Configurations *

The Adventureland+ game and the base MCSMP ROM image were designed for 1802
Membership Card computers with RAM starting at 0000, ROM starting at 8000, and
the rev. J or newer front panel PCB.  The base ROM image is a special version
of MCSMP20J.BIN which includes support for launching the game.

In order to modify the game for systems with ROM in the low address space and
RAM in the high space, do the following:

1. Change the addresses 0010H and 0013H in "game_ram.asm" and
   "game_rom_core.asm" to 8010H and 8013H respectively
2. Change address $CA00 in "game_rom_loader.asm" to $4A00.
3. Replace the "mcsmp20r_base.bin" file with MCSMP20B.BIN.
4. In build_rom.py, change the line which begins with:
     ulzData = chr(0xC0) + chr(0xCA) + chr(0x00)
   to instead begin with:
     ulzData = chr(0xC0) + chr(0x4A) + chr(0x00)
5. In game_rom_loader.asm, in the line with the instruction "LDI  $D0"
   immediately after the "DecompressOkay" label, change this instruction to:
   "LDI  $50".  Four lines below this, change "LDI  $00" to "LDI  $80".
   Finally, at the bottom of this function, change "LBR  $0010" to
   "LBR  $8010"

In order to modify the game for systems with the Rev I. or earlier version of
the front panel PCB, all of the serial I/O routines, which occupy the first
465 lines of "adventureland.asm" must be modified to invert the logical
polarity of the output signal relative to that of the input signal. I believe
that this can be accomplished by appropriately changing the conditional jump
instructions found on lines 666 and 711 of adventureland.asm, as well as the
polarity of the jump instructions in the 4800 baud and lower input routine,
and its matching code modification routine at lines 767 through 791. However
this task is left as an exercise for the reader.

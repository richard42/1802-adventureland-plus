; The FakeBootLoader is here so that the first LBR instruction at the beginning of the binary
; program will tell the build script the size of the program data to compress. The LBR instruction
; here will tell the build script the address of the game startup routine.
;
; When the game is launched from ROM, after decompressing the game data into RAM at address 8013H,
; the LBR instruction at 8010 will be over-written by code in game_rom_loader.asm to instead jump
; to the game's starting address in RAM.
